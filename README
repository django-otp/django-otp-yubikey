This is a django-otp plugin that handles `YubiKey
<http://www.yubico.com/yubikey>`_ devices using the Yubico OTP algorithm. This
includes two device definitions: one to verify YubiKey tokens locally and
another to verify them against a `web service
<http://www.yubico.com/yubicloud>`_.

See `django-otp <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-otp>`_ for more information
on the OTP framework.

This version is supported on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3; and Django >= 1.4.
